## TURN STRUCTURE

The game proceeds in rounds called **Turns**. Each turn has **5 phases** that all players participate in simultaneously:

### Phase 1: PLANNING PHASE
All players secretly plan their actions by placing Order Tokens on their Player Board to indicate:
- Which ships will move (and where)
- Which shipyards will construct ships
- Which ships will deploy as new shipyards
- Which ships will receive repairs or upgrades

Players do NOT reveal their plans yet.

### Phase 2: INCOME PHASE
All players collect gold based on their empire:
- **Base Income:** 10 gold
- **+5 gold** per Shipyard you control
- **+2 gold** per Ship you command

Record new gold totals on your Player Board.

### Phase 3: REVEAL & RESOLUTION PHASE
All players simultaneously reveal their planned orders. Resolve actions in this strict order:

1. **Deploy Shipyards** - Convert ships into shipyard structures
2. **Queue Ship Construction** - Add ships to shipyard build queues
3. **Repair Ships** - Restore health to damaged vessels
4. **Upgrade Ships** - Improve sails, cannons, or max health
5. **Attack Shipyards** - Assault enemy structures
6. **Movement** - Ships sail to new locations

### Phase 4: ENCOUNTER RESOLUTION PHASE
If ships from different players attempt to occupy the same hex OR swap positions:
- An **Encounter** occurs (see Combat Rules)
- Players make tactical decisions
- Combat may result

### Phase 5: CONSTRUCTION PHASE
All shipyards with queued ships make progress:
- First ship in each queue advances 1 turn toward completion
- Ships require **3 turns** to complete
- Completed ships are placed on their shipyard's Harbor tile
- Draw a Ship Name Card for new vessels

**Then advance to the next turn.**

## COMBAT RULES

### When Combat Occurs

Combat happens during **Encounters**, which are triggered when:

1. **PASSING Encounter:** Two ships attempt to swap positions in the same turn
2. **ENTRY Encounter:** Two or more ships attempt to enter the same hex

### Encounter Decision Phase

When an Encounter is detected, the turn pauses and involved players make decisions:

#### For PASSING Encounters (Ship Swap)
Each player secretly chooses:
- **PROCEED** - Allow peaceful passage
- **ATTACK** - Engage in combat

**Resolution:**
- If both choose PROCEED → Ships swap positions peacefully
- If either chooses ATTACK → Combat occurs, ships remain in original positions

#### For ENTRY Encounters (Same Destination)
Each player secretly chooses:
- **YIELD** - Stay in current position
- **ATTACK** - Contest the tile

**Resolution:**
- All choose YIELD → No ships move
- Only one chooses ATTACK → That ship enters the hex, others blocked
- Multiple choose ATTACK → **Contested Tile** is created

### Contested Tiles

When multiple ships contest the same hex:
1. Place a **Contested Tile Marker** on the disputed hex
2. All involved ships remain in their previous positions
3. Combat occurs **once per turn** until resolved
4. No other ships can enter a Contested Tile
5. The Contested state persists across turns until only one faction remains

### Combat Resolution

**Step 1: Roll Dice**
- **Attacker** rolls **3d6**, keeps the highest 2 dice
- **Defender** rolls **2d6**, keeps both dice

**Step 2: Compare Results**
Compare the highest die from each side:
- If Attacker's die > Defender's die → Attacker wins comparison
- If Defender's die ≥ Attacker's die → Defender wins comparison (ties go to defender)

Then compare the second-highest die:
- Same rules as above

**Step 3: Deal Damage**
For each comparison won:
- Winner deals damage = **2 base damage + Cannon upgrades**
- Example: Ship with 3 Cannon upgrades deals 5 damage per comparison won

**Step 4: Check for Destruction**
- If a ship reaches 0 HP → Ship is destroyed
- Remove ship from game
- Destroyed ships count toward elimination

**Step 5: Resolve Encounter**
- If all ships on one side destroyed → Other side wins
- Winning ships occupy the tile (or swap positions)
- If Contested Tile, remove marker if only one faction remains

---

## WINNING THE GAME

### Elimination
A player is **eliminated** when they control **zero ships**.
- Shipyards alone do NOT prevent elimination
- Eliminated players remove all their pieces from the board

### Victory
The last player with ships remaining **wins the game immediately**.

---

## ADDITIONAL RULES & CLARIFICATIONS

### AI Enemy Behavior (Optional Solo/Co-op Mode)
If playing with automated opponents, use this decision matrix:
- **If Ship HP < 50% of Max** → Choose YIELD or PROCEED (defensive)
- **If Ship HP ≥ 50% of Max** → Choose ATTACK (aggressive)

### Deterministic Combat Variant
For tournament play, replace dice with a **seeded random number generator** or pre-rolled combat results table to ensure reproducible outcomes.

### Simultaneous Turn Clarification
- All players plan in secret during Planning Phase
- Orders are revealed simultaneously
- No player has knowledge of opponent moves until Resolution Phase
- Actions resolve in strict priority order (Deploy → Build → Repair → Upgrade → Attack → Move)

### Tie-Breaking
If multiple actions of the same type occur simultaneously:
- Resolve in clockwise turn order from first player
- First player rotates each round

### Movement Edge Cases
- Ships cannot move diagonally across two Land tiles (no squeezing through gaps)
- Pathfinding must use continuous Sea/Harbor tiles
- If a planned path becomes blocked by enemy ships, movement stops at last valid tile

### Shipyard Destruction
- Shipyards being built when destroyed lose all progress
- Ships in queue are lost (no refund)
- New shipyards can be deployed on now-empty Harbor tiles

### Maximum Limits
- **12 ships per player** (hard cap - cannot build more)
- **4 shipyards per player** (recommended limit, can adjust for longer games)
- **5 ships per shipyard queue** (strict limit)

---

## ADVANCED RULES (Optional)

### Fog of War
Players cannot see opponent ship health or upgrade levels unless ships are within 3 hexes. Use face-down status cards.

### Island Bonuses
Islands can provide special bonuses:
- **Treasure Islands:** +10 gold when shipyard deployed
- **Supply Islands:** Ships repair for free
- **Fortress Islands:** Shipyards have +10 HP

### Legendary Ships
Draw 4 Legendary Ship cards at start. These ships start with 20 HP and 1 Cannon upgrade.

### Team Play (4 Players)
Play in 2v2 teams. Teams share gold income and victory conditions but control ships separately.

## DESIGN NOTES

**Plunk and Plunder** emphasizes:
- **Simultaneous decision-making** to eliminate downtime
- **Economic engine building** through shipyard placement
- **Tactical positioning** to avoid or force combat
- **Risk management** in upgrade vs expansion trade-offs

The game rewards players who balance aggression with economy, anticipate opponent movements, and position fleets to control strategic choke points around valuable islands.
